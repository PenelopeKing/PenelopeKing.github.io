## About Me
Hello! I'm Penelope King, an aspiring data scientist with a background in machine learning, programming, and collaborative teamwork. I am currently a third year data science undergraduate at University of California, San Diego and expecting to graduate in March 2025.

Currently I am working at Glass Lab at UCSD School of Medicine, and am looking for future opporunities where I can extend and grow my data science skillsets.
  
## Projects: 
### Restaurant Rating Prediction / Recommender System
* [Project Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hPbwxCA0s6dhh3w1OPSqWd2b3721-QjR/view?usp=sharing){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
* Python project (sklearn, seaborn, numpy, matplotlib, pandas, tensorflow)

![Alt text](figures/tfidf_restaurant.png?raw=true "Comparing most relevant words by restaurant rating")
![Alt text](figures/eda_restaurant.png?raw=true "EDA")
In this project I trialed different recommender system modeling methods for a prediction problem using a Google resturant review dataset. Some of the methods involved techniques such as utilizing latent factors, while others involved no latent factors. In addition to testing multiple machine learning models, I also performed exploratory data analysis on the dataset, feature engineering, and explored past literature.

### Travel Analysis
* [Project Link](https://github.com/PenelopeKing/travel-analysis/)
* Python project (pandas, sklearn, seaborn, statsmodels, numpy)

In this group project, I explored into international traveler behavior coming into the US to analyze if the strength of the USD and the appearance of natural disasters and federal emergencies had a significant impact on tourism into the United States. In this project I took a lead role in the design, EDA, and modeling stages.

### Power Outage Model
* [Project Link – EDA](https://garveyjli.github.io/power_outage_data_exploration/)  •  [Project Link – Model](https://penelopeking.github.io/power-outage-model/)
* Python project (pandas, sklearn, numpy, matplotlib)

This project focuses on predicting the cause of a power outage. Sometimes power outages may occur due to unexpected reasons and the cause for it would be unclear. This project aims to build a classifier using information that is available shortly after a power outage. Aside from model testing and feature engineering, this project also consisted of EDA, looking at past research, and studying the fairness of our final model through hypothesis testing.

### Breast Cancer Tissue Classification
* [Project Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LI0R1Y18HjTU_nr6GSBPy8-FssIv5OMI/view?usp=sharing)
* Python project (pandas, statsmodels, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)

This project aimed to predict the malignancy of breast tumors using various information about the tumor’s cell nuclei’s shape and appearance using a dataset of processed tumor images. Being able to accurately predict a tumor cell’s malignancy using its nucleus would be a very important tool to help cancer patients go forward with treatment before they reach a more critical stage of cancer. In our project, we aimed to classify breast tumor mass cells as either malignant or benign using a logistic regression classification model based on data about the tissue’s nuclei measurements. In addition to studying past research, this project also consisted of EDA, feature engineering, and model testing.
